# Rock-vs-Mine-Prediction
This is a Supervised machine learning project which typically involves training a machine learning model to differentiate between rocks and mines based on certain features or characteristics. The goal is to develop a model that can accurately classify sonar readings or other data into one of these two categories.

Here is the summary of the steps involved in this project:-
Data Collection: Gather a dataset containing labeled examples of rocks and mines. This dataset should include relevant features or attributes, such as sonar readings, spectral data, or any other measurable characteristics that can help distinguish between rocks and mines.

1) Data Preprocessing:-
   Clean and preprocess the data to ensure it is in a suitable format for training. This may involve handling missing values, normalizing or scaling the features, and     
   splitting the data into training and testing sets.

2) Feature Selection/Extraction:-
   Identify the most relevant features that contribute to the classification task. This can be done through feature selection techniques or by extracting meaningful 
   features from the raw data. Domain knowledge and exploratory data analysis can guide this process.

3) Model Selection:-
   Choose an appropriate machine learning algorithm or model for the classification task. Some common choices for this type of problem include logistic regression, support 
   vector machines (SVM), decision trees, random forests, or neural networks. But I have used Logistic Regression for the prediction.

5) Model Training:-
   Train the selected model using the labeled training data. The model learns from the features and their corresponding labels, adjusting its internal parameters to improve 
   its predictive capabilities.

7) Model Evaluation:-
   Evaluate the trained model using the testing set to assess its performance. Common evaluation metrics for binary classification tasks include accuracy, precision,   
   recall, and F1 score. These metrics help determine how well the model generalizes to unseen data.

9) Model Optimization:-
   Fine-tune the model and its hyperparameters to achieve better performance. This can involve techniques such as cross-validation, grid search, or random search to find 
   the best combination of hyperparameters for the model.

11) Prediction:-
    Once the model is trained and optimized, it can be used to make predictions on new, unseen data. Given new sonar readings or other relevant input, the model will 
    classify them as either rocks or mines based on what it has learned during training.


By following these steps, a rock vs. mine prediction ML project aims to create a model that can accurately classify unseen data, which can be valuable in various applications, such as underwater mine detection or geological studies.
